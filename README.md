This is a library which provides a set of tools that make it easy to access the Bing Maps REST services in AL.

* **Isochrones** (drive time polygons)
* **Snap to Road API** - snap GPS points to their closest logical point on a road. Also provides speed limit data
* **Traffic incident data**
* **Elevation data**
